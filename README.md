This is a phone app that prevents a candle lighter from buring their house down by forgetting to blow it out.

Phase 1:
- Click a button to light a candle.
- Click a button to blow out a candle.
- After 4 hours, remind me to blow out the candle.

Phase 2:
- If I have a candle lit and I leave the house, remind me to blow it out
- Talk to Google to accomplish these commands

Phase 3:
- Sync a household of phones?
- Integrate with messaging if the timer goes off and I'm not at home
  
NOTE: This is a very simple app that I'm creating to remember how to code, and also play around with some tech that I haven't used before.
